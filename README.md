#### Automation testing of a website (Demo Web Shop: https://demowebshop.tricentis.com/)

### Introduction

The Demo Web Shop is an online shopping platform that allows users to browse and purchase various electronic products. The platform provides multiple categories for users to explore, enabling them to view product details, add products to their cart, and place orders.
This project was undertaken as part of an automation testing initiative to apply the knowledge and skills gained during automation testing training. It incorporates industry-standard tools and frameworks such as Selenium, TestNG, Cucumber, a hybrid framework, and advanced reporting tools like Allure/Extent.

### Objective
The main objective of this project is to automate various workflows of the Demo Web Shop platform using Selenium with TestNG, BDD Cucumber, the Page Object Model (POM) and many other features. The data required for the tests is retrieved from external sources such as data sheets (Excel) and properties files. By implementing automation, the testing process becomes faster, more accurate, and more efficient, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency across multiple test executions.
The project follows a hybrid automation framework, integrating different testing techniques and tools to provide a robust and scalable solution. This document provides a detailed breakdown of the concepts used, the structure of the project, the purpose of each file, and the functionalities implemented.
